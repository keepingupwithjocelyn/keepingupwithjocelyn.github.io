<h1>About Jocelyn!</h1>
<h2>Family</h2> <br>
<p> I come from a single parent home. My mom and dad divorced when I was a baby.<br>
	Patty,my mother later married Pablo. They had a daughter together named<br>
	Olivia. Olivia and I have become so close over the past two years. We are inseaparable!<br>
	Other than my immediate family, I have so many cousins. On my moms side she has nine<br>
	sisters and just one brother. All of them combined have twenty-one kids.<br>
	We were all raised super close, just like brothers and sister. We can<br>
	trust eachother with everything. They are all my bestfriends. <br> </p>

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p> I am really interested in politics. Politics is perfect for debates and taking a stand for <br>
    what you believe is right. It changes your view on things when thinking about all people around you,<br>
    and you no longer think about yourself but consider those around you and what's fair to all of you. <br>
	Since I was tiny all I can remember is my aunts and uncles talking about politics. They are all democrats<br>
	and so am I. I had the oppurtunity to go to Hillary Clinton's presidential rally in Long Beach. I shook her<br>
	hand!!! I also was able to go to Bernie Sanders rally at the Stub Hub center. That rally was so much fun<br>
	and the people there were so cool.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I really enjoy watching Youtube. Youtube has so many genres and is a very diverse website where people can express<br>
  themselves and show others who they truly are and what they are passionate about. Some of my favorite youtubers are<br>
   Mikey Murphy, Loveliveserve, and the Dolan Twins. They always put a smile on my face. You should check them out! They<br>
   all have very unique contents, especially loveliveserve. They make skits, and react to videos. <br>

<h2>Skills</h2>
<p>I am technologicaly advanced. You see this website, yeah well I created it with my own code! I attend to Bancroft <br>
middle school, and in the ATM program. In this program I learn so many new techniques in computers, that will help <br>
help me later on in life. Not only am I good with computers, I play soccer. I play for a club called FC Long Beach.<br>
 I have played with the same team for over 4 years. All of those girls are like family to me. We root eachother on the <br>
 sidelines and in our lifes. I also branched out of my club team, and played for Bancroft Middle School. We made it to semi-finals but<br>
 sadly we did not make it past that.
