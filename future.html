<h1>My Future</h1>
<h2>HighSchool</h2> <br>
<p> After I am done with middle school, I will move on to highschool. The highschool I plan to go to is<br>
 Lakewood Highschool. Lakewood is right by Bancroft, and is a traditional highschool. I hope to get into the ATM<br>
 program. They are partnered with UC Irvine. UC Irvine is looking for the next female engineers and I plan to be one<br>
 of them. I will work really hard in highshool to be succesful during college.<br> </p>

<h2>College</h2>
<p> Not many of my family members in my dad's side have completed college. They went, but later dropped out. I hope <br>
to change that though. I plan to go to UC Irvine or Dominguez Hills. That would be a dream! But to be honest, I would go <br>
any where where someone would give me an opurtunity to learn at.  </p>

<h2>Career Interests</h2>
<p> Right now, I don't really know what I'd like to be. I know these decisions can change whenever. But something that<br>
really interests me right now is the law enforcment field. I would really like to be a homicide detective. It's just something<br>
that seems like it'll never get boring, and I can use the clues left at the scene to bring the end of grief to a broken family. <br>
Another thing that I am considering right now is being a probation officer. I would really like to dedicate my time to those who <br>
need a little more support getting their life back in order. It is not fair to see someone for who they were in the past but focus<br>
on what will happen in the future.
