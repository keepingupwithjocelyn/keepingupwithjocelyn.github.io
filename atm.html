<h1>ATM Program </h1>
<h2>Sixth Grade</h2> <br>
<p> During sixth grade we learned the basics of computers and how to stay safe when using the internet.<br>
 Mrs. McClure taught us that the web is a wonderful place to express yourself and show others who you are<br>
 but you also have to be catious about what you put out there and who you communicate with. We also learned<br>
  how to use Microsoft Word. Which is a skill that will be so usefull when we grow up and have to write a <br>
  resume. Sixth grade did not need your creative input, but you learned the most useful programs, that you <br>
   you will use for the rest of your life. I'm not saying you did not do anything fun at all. We had the chance<br>
   to code shapes and make our own logos. It was so much fun! <br> </p>

<h2>Seventh Grade</h2>
<p> Seventh grade was so much fun. This is where the magic happened. We learned a lot about photography. When I first <br>
learned the rules about how to take a picture, I honestly thought it was pointless. But now when I take instagram pictures<br>
I know a good and bad photo when I see one. This wasn't the only thing I learned. I was taught how to make houses, buildings, <br>
offices in SketchUP. If you do not know what this is, it is basically a designer program where you could make 3D models. <br>
If you have a child that is thinking about entering ATM. Do it!! Make sure that they know seventh grade will be so much fun.<br> </p>

<h2>Eighth Grade</h2>
<p> As of right now I'm in eighth grade. So far I have done so many cool things. All of my class had the chance to <br>
create our own movies and share them with the class. Not only have we done movies but we made our own beats in <br>
GarageBand. That was probably my favourite thing to do. You had a clean slate to create something wonderful.<br>
And I am so thankful to have classmates that are respectful and don't critisize your work since we are all learning<br>
together.
